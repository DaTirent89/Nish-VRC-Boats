# Nish-VRC-Boats
A functional, smooth boat script for making sailing maps in VRChat. Easy to change the boat's textures, or speed/rotation speed.
Multiplayer fully synced already.

INSTALL REQUIREMENTS:
You need CyanTrigger for this asset! Add CyanTrigger to the VRC SDK here - https://cyanlaser.github.io/CyanTrigger/

Prefab Setup:  (IF YOU DON'T DO THIS YOU WILL SLIDE OFF THE BOAT)
There is a folder within the package named UdonPlatformHook. Add the prefab into your hierarchy, and click it.
In the components, choose the layer you will have the boats on. Using Default doesn't affect performance from what I've seen.

Add the NishBoatsPrefab to your hierarchy and that's it! There are integrated respawn buttons, three premade boats, and another surprise.

Happy Sailing! -Nish
